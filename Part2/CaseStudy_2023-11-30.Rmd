```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Overview

Now we will use all of the skills we have learned in this workshop in a real world case study. This example walks through using R and publicly available datasets to examine how drought is influencing wind erosion in the Chihuahuan Desert. Our goal is to reproduce Figure 4 from McCord et al. 2024 (DOI LINK).

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
